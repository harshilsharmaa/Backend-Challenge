## Level 3: Algorithm
 1. Find protein by calories ratio i.e protein/calories for each food item.
 2. Sort the food item in ascending order according to the ratio.
 3. Apply a loop over food items ansd check:
    - if (foodItem calories > total calories) if yes: reject , if No consider it.
    - if ( current calories + foodItem calories > total calories) if yes: reject, if no consider it.
 4. if the number of food item is greater than 5 and the protein requirement is not satisfied than repeat step 3 again.
 5. Stop, and we get our food items.


### Level 1 and Level 2 are in code.
